                <h2>Extracting 25 TFLOPS from AWS Lambda, or #TheCloudIsTooDamnHard</h2>
<p><strong>Note : this blog post originally appeared on ericjonas.com and
pertains to an earlier version of pywren </strong></p>
<p>Recently at the Berkeley Center for Computational Imaging weekly
lunch, my wonderful
colleague <a href="http://shivaram.org/">Shivaram Venkataraman</a> from
the <a href="https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/">AMP Lab</a> explained cloud
infrastructure to a smart group of physicists, electrical engineers,
applied mathematicians, and biologists. Even focusing on great
technologies like <a href="http://spark.apache.org/">Spark</a>
and <a href="http://dask.pydata.org/en/latest/">Dask</a> the conclusion was that
#thecloudistoodamnhard. There is a tremendous activation energy in 
provisioning servers, worrying about piecewise-constant resource pricing
and complex storage models, and doing devops work. <a href="https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/yirenng.html">Professor Ren Ng</a> asked
why there was no "cloud button" that one could push and instantly have
their current environment up and running on cloud-hosted infrastructure. </p>
<p>And recently, my friend and cofounder @BeauCronin has been tweeting about <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23thecloudiwant&amp;src=typd">#TheCloudIWant</a> :
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheCloudIWant?src=hash">#TheCloudIWant</a> charges me for ~only and exactly~ what I use, and I never have to provision or reserve capacity for any resource.</p>&mdash; Beau Cronin (@beaucronin) <a href="https://twitter.com/beaucronin/status/788756820315607041">October 19, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>I think all of this criticism and pining for "something better" is quite correct.
While a fraction of my time involves scaling distributed compute
to TB datasets across hundreds of machines, a lot of what I do
is embarrassingly parallel jobs doing hyperparameter sweeps, Monte Carlo
simulations of physical systems, and validation of datasets. I get an
algorithm working and then immediately think "I want to test this on
100 input datasets" and then write a for loop and learn to be patient. </p>
<p>There has to be a better way. </p>
<p>Given I sit in the AMP Lab, why not Spark? The spark programming model still
requires the provisioning of dedicated servers and currently has poor support
for elasticity. Additionally, there are a lot of complications with pyspark
that make getting started a challenge. If someone had a robust local cluster,
there might be a universe where pyspark would be easy enough to use, but
the friction with AWS makes this a challenge. </p>
<h2>AWS Lambda</h2>
<p>Recent interest in "microservices" has led to various cloud companies
offering the ability to execute short-run tasks with minimal overhead. 
These offerings are still a bit immature and limited. For example,
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">AWS Lambda</a> gives each lambda task:</p>
<ul>
<li>a single Nehalem-generation core (exact performance varies a bit)</li>
<li>1536 MB of RAM max</li>
<li>512 MB of <code>/tmp/</code> storage</li>
<li>300s max execution time. </li>
<li>a runtime that's either python, node, or Java</li>
</ul>
<p>This isn't much, and the runtimes are a limited, although I was 
curious if it was still enough to do real scientific computing. 
This is what resulted. </p>
<h2>Design Goals:</h2>
<p>Additionally, I really wanted to see if there were an easier way to
make elastic compute resources available to my non-CS non-devops
colleagues. I wanted to make Ren's "cloud button" more viable. What I
really wanted was:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Very little overhead for setup once someone has an AWS account. In
particular, no persistent overhead -- you don't have to keep a large
(expensive) cluster up and you don't have to wait 10+ min for a cluster
to come up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As close to zero overhead for users as possible -- in particular,
anyone who can write python should be able to invoke it through a
reasonable interface.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Target jobs that run in the minutes-or-more regime. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don't want to run a service. That is, I personally don't want to
offer the front-end for other people to use, rather, I want to
directly pay AWS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It has to be from a cloud player that's likely to give out
an academic grant -- AWS, Google, Azure. There are startups
in this space that might build cool technology, but often
don't want to be paid in AWS research credits. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>PyWren</h2>
<p>So I wrote <a href="https://github.com/ericmjonas/pywren">PyWren</a> in my "spare
time" (fellow postdocs will get why this is in quotes) to let you do
exactly this. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The wrens are mostly small, brownish passerine birds in the mainly New World family Troglodytidae. ... Most wrens are small and rather inconspicuous, except for their loud and often complex songs. - Wikipedia</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's a microservices-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTCondor">Condor</a>, a Wren! (Working with <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~brecht/">this guy</a> leads to a real focus on ridiculous naming). 
It's basically just "map-reduce" minus the "reduce"
using AWS Lambda and some
awesome
<a href="https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle">python serialization technology</a> originally
developed by a now-defunct company
called
<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/picloud#/entity">PiCloud</a>
that offered a similar service that I loved. </p>
<p>The interface is as close to
the
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html">Python futures </a> interface
as I could make it. Right now it basically just supports <code>map(func, data_list)</code>. </p>
<p>As a trival example, let's add 1 to the first 10 numbers from our laptop. With PyWren
installed locally:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">pywren</span>
<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">numpy</span> <span class="kn">as</span> <span class="nn">np</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">addone</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span>

<span class="n">wrenexec</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">pywren</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">default_executor</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="n">xlist</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">np</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">arange</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">futures</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">wrenexec</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">map</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">addone</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">xlist</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="k">print</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">result</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">f</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">futures</span><span class="p">]</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The output is as expected:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
</pre></div>


<p>Behind the scenes, the following has occurred:</p>
<ol>
<li>PyWren, running on your laptop (the <strong>host</strong>), serializes both the
function <code>addone()</code> along with necessary modules, and the data, and
sticks both in s3. We call this <strong>host submit</strong></li>
<li>PyWren then invokes the lambda function. <strong>job start</strong> is reached
once aws begins calling the lambda function handler. </li>
<li>The lambda function handler first downloads a full Anaconda python
   stack, at which point <strong>job setup</strong> is done.</li>
<li>The handler invokes the function <code>f</code> on the serialized data <code>x</code>
from within the downloaded python stack.</li>
<li>When that completes, the result is placed in S3, and we have <strong>job done</strong>. </li>
<li>On the host, f.result() blocks polling for the existence of the s3
object, and when it is available downloads and unpickles it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, we can do more computationally-intensive actions, like computing
the product of 1600 random matrices with varying standard deviations. 
My colleague <a href="http://etrain.github.io/about.html">Evan Sparks</a> pointed
out that the BLAS operation <code>DGEMM</code> is a great thing to benchmark. So
here we're running BLAS doing a double dense matrix-matrix multiply,
and we can measure the total number of FLOPS.  (for the remainder we
use
a
<a href="https://github.com/ericmjonas/pywren/blob/master/examples/benchmark.py">slightly-better instrumented version</a> of
the below code).</p>

<p>Now we can plot and track the results:</p>
<p><a href="/images/pywren.jobs.png"><img src="/images/pywren.jobs.png" style="max-width:100%"></a>
We can mark when each job was submitted by the host (blue dot), when lambda began processing it
(green dot), when the initial setup was done (black dot), and when the job itself
completed (red dot). </p>
<p>Interesting things to note:</p>
<ul>
<li>The rate of submitting jobs is slow, due to network overhead and possibly
may be some rate-limiting going on via the amazon side. </li>
<li>Most lambda jobs start very quickly after host submission. The
variance increases the more active running jobs there are, though.</li>
<li>Setup can take a while -- for this short job, it's ~20% of the
execution time, although the jobs themselves take on average ~75
seconds (less than the 300s max), so there is room to reduce this
overhead percentage.</li>
<li>Some jobs finish incredibly quickly, suggesting they are
running on faster / less-contested hardware. </li>
<li>There are some real stragglers -- note the cluster of jobs finishing
  around 180s.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can then compute the effective total throughput
as a function of time (blue line):  including overhead, how many GFLOPS
did this task run at? We can also compute the total peak
GFLOPS in flight (green) -- how many simultaneous GFLOPS are being computed at this
moment, across the entire job pool.
<a href="/images/pywren.gflops.png"><img src="/images/pywren.gflops.png" style="max-width:100%"></a></p>
<p>Note the effective flops rises quickly once jobs start returning, and
then declines slowly as we wait for the stragglers. The blue line peaks
when the maximum number of simultaneous lambda workers is crunching
on threads, which <strong>peaks at over 25 TFLOPS</strong>! This feels amazing
for a bunch of plain-old python processes. </p>
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>Anti-goals: </p>
<ol>
<li>I don't want to support inter-task computation or IPC. I just want a
<code>map</code> that works as transparently as possible. </li>
<li>We are not optimizing for tasks with duration &lt; 20s. Overhead is non-trivial </li>
</ol>
<p>This isn't a generic compute platform yet -- in addition to the 
limitations on invidiual lambda processes listed above, marshalling
the python code intelligently isn't totally debugged, and the 
small space in <code>/tmp</code> means we're limited in how much of the
pydata stack we can install on the worker. </p>
<p>But I am making a bet that the limitations on this sort of worker will
improve in the near future. To pull this off, I had to e-mail AWS and
request an increase in simultaneous lambda workers to 2000, which they
quickly did.  The ideal case is of course a lambda-like service that
runs arbitrary containers quickly with fixed resource budgets,</p>
<h2>The future</h2>
<p>We can make cloud compute easier for scientific computing users. We
can bring the power of elasticity to the masses. While fun, there
aren't hard systems challenges here, it's just about polishing things
well enough to compel regular users.  Indeed, this is a
place
<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/picloud#/entity">a few startups</a> have
tried to succeed in, although it's most likely not viable as a
stand-alone business model.  More and more people are starting to try
and do real work with microservices. My
friend and colleague <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~keithw/">Keith Winstein</a> , for
example, has been doing amazing research in this space for video
codecs, and was instrumental in helping me understand the early
limitations of Lambda. </p>
<p>So try <a href="https://github.com/ericmjonas/pywren">PyWren</a>
 out, look in the <a href="https://github.com/ericmjonas/pywren/tree/master/examples"><code>examples</code></a>  directory, and if you're the sort of
 person who wants to run a lot of small-ish jobs in parallel let me
 know! </p>
<p><em>Special thanks to Ren Ng for the original motivitation to actually
implement this, the PiCloud founders back in 2008 for offering a
near-identical service back when it was hard, Shivaram Venkataraman
and Evan Sparks for help in early implementation and real guidance,
and Keith Winstein for showing me it was possible to run 1000+ lambda
instances simultaneously, and as always, Ben Recht for letting me
fool around like this instead of writing papers.</em></p>
